          Bangladesh (বাংলাদেশ, pronounced as [banglaˌdeS]), officially the
          People's Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is the
          eighth-most populous country in the world, with a population exceeding
          163 million people in an area of either 148,460 square kilometer
          (57,320 sq mi) or 147,570 square kilometer (56,980 sq mi) making it
          one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Bangladesh
          shares land borders with India to the west, north, and east, Myanmar
          to the southeast, and the Bay of Bengal to the south. It is narrowly
          separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the Siliguri Corridor; and from
          China by the Indian state of Sikkim in the north, respectively. Dhaka,
          the capital and largest city, is the nation's economic, political, and
          cultural hub. Chittagong, the largest seaport, is the second-largest
          city. Bangladesh forms the larger and eastern part of the Bengal
          region. According to the ancient Indian texts, Rāmāyana and
          Mahābhārata, the Vanga Kingdom, one of the namesakes of the Bengal
          region, was a strong naval power. In the ancient and classical periods
          of the Indian subcontinent, the territory was home to many
          principalities, including the Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and
          Harikela. It was also a Mauryan province under the reign of Ashoka.
          The principalities were notable for their overseas trade, contacts
          with the Roman world, the export of fine muslin and silk to the Middle
          East, and spreading of philosophy and art to Southeast Asia. The Gupta
          Empire, Pala Empire, the Chandra dynasty, and the Sena dynasty were
          the last pre-Islamic Bengali middle kingdoms. Islam was introduced
          during the Pala Empire, through trade with the Abbāsid Caliphate, but
          following the Ghurid conquests led by Bakhtiyār Khaljī, the
          establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and preaching of Shah Jalāl in
          the north-east, it spread across the entire region. In 1576, the
          wealthy Bengal Sultanate was absorbed into the Mughal Empire, but its
          rule was briefly interrupted by the Sūr Empire.

            <h2 class="division-name color-khaki">Khulna</h2>
            <p>
              Khulna was part of the ancient kingdoms of Vanga and Samatata. It
              became a part of the Sena dynasty during the 12th-century reign of
              Ballala Sena, and formed part of the Bagri division of Bengal. The
              region's previous name was Jahanabad. During the 14th century,
              Shamsuddin Firoz Shah was the first Muslim ruler to arrive in the
              city. Muslim settlements increased during the time of Shamsuddin
              Ilyas Shah, and many mosques and shrines were established. A
              Muslim saint, Khan Jahan Ali, acquired a jagir (fiefdom) with a
              large portion of the Khulna Division from the king of Gauḍa during
              the 15th century. Ali exercised the full rights of sovereignty
              until his death in 1459.

            <p>
              Barisal was conquered by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji and was
              later a significant territory of the Delhi Sultanate and Bengal
              Sultanate. After the decline of the Suri Empire, the territory
              became a semi-independent area in the Mughal period because of
              heavy fighting between the Muslims and Hindu chiefs, although most
              parts of the city were totally under the control of the governors
              of the proto-industrialised Bengal Subah. In course of time, it
              fell under the Bengal Nawabs. Raja Ramranjan Chakravarty was put
              as a de jure king during the Bengal Presidency of the British,
              later passed to East Pakistan at independence and finally
              Bangladesh.
